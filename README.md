# What we're create?
We create a website-based application that can detect waste in real time based on its type such as Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable using YOLOv5 as a model. With this application, we can educate people about the importance of protecting the environment by recognizing waste that can be decomposed easily (Biodegradable) and which cannot be easily decomposed (Non-Biodegradable).
